# Web Chess

Simple website that allows users to play chess online.
No logic is implemented client side as https://gitlab.com/geckospaniel/chess handles everything.

# Usage

Since this website communicates with a server:
- An instance of the server needs to exist somewhere on the internet
- The websocket address in `board.js` needs to be adjusted (Subject to change)
